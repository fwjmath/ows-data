Data and code of Odd Weird Search performed on yoyo@home

## Code

The source code (``wobt-smart.cpp``) is released under GPL 3.0. It contains some code in the public domain from [Thomas R. Nicely](https://www.trnicely.net). This code uses the [MPIR](https://www.mpir.org) library and the GCC-specific data type ``__int128``. By default, this code compiles into a standalone application, but it was also meant to be compiled as a [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu) application to be run on the volunteer computing project [yoyo@home](https://www.rechenkraft.net/yoyo/) by setting the macro ``__USING_BOINC``.

We note that the source code is for a search with a limit on the abundance of numbers. To remove this limit, either modify the code in the function ``search``, or putting the abundance bound in the input file as high as the upper bound of numbers.

And sorry for the badly written code that also lacks adequate comments...

## Application behavior

The application reads an input file indicating the part of factorization tree to search, then it searches for an [odd weird number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weird_number). When the search is terminated, a result file is written, and the application terminates.

As an application designed for volunteer computing, after reaching a certain quantity of computation, the application will stop and write a checkpoint file, which is then sent back to the server. The checkpoint file has the same format as the input file. For more details, see

## Data format

### Input/checkpoint file

Here is an example of an input/checkpoint file

```
10000000000000000000000000000
1000000000000000000000
100000000000000
10
25310984
20000000611
37940809052
252390246
919117
1 1 3
2 1 5
3 1 7
6 1 17
13 1 43
37 1 163
87 1 457
154 1 907
2993 1 27397
```

Here is an explanation of the meaning of each line:

- Line 1: Upper bound of numbers that we check
- Line 2: Lower bound of numbers that we check
- Line 3: Upper bound of abundance of numbers that we check
- Line 4: Recursion depth (the number of distinct prime factors of the current number)
- Line 5: Number of odd weird candidates that are checked so far
- Line 6: Workpoint, a rough estimate of work already done in the current workunit, based on certain statistics on subset sum instances that are solved
- Line 7: Primepoint, a rough estimate of work already done in the current workunit, based on the number of primality tests executed up to now
- Line 8: Checksum, a quantity mixing various statistics to ensure correct computation by volunteers
- Line 9: The number of sections left in the current workunit
- The rest: Factorization of the current number. Each line corresponds to a prime, the first number is the index of the prime, the second its power, the third its value.

### Result file

A result file has roughly the same format as input/checkpoint files, with an extra line (the information line) at the end. There are several possibilities:

- "t": needed to recycle
- "c": completed, no recycle needed
- A message when an odd weird number is found.
